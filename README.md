# DynX: Graphical Modular Dynamic Programming

⚠️ **Experimental Development Build** – APIs and documentation are incomplete.⚠️ 

DynX is a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) framework for solving recursive
dynamic models. 

DynX provides a practical and unified
graph representation of Bellman functional recursion (model solution) and push-forward distributions (model simulation) of a dynamic economic model. 

Unlike general graph libraries (e.g. *TensorFlow*), DynX represents **both**
computational operators **and** the functional objects that define a
recursive problem.
